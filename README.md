# Vere App

A very basic django app that shows two side by side images on page load/re-load
from wikimedia's commons.

It could have just as easily been a simple static site.

It is currently deployed at [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/),
accesible through [here](https://vere-app.pythonanywhere.com/).
